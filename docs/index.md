# Documentation for CompNeuroPy

CompNeuroPy is an assisting Python package for working with ANNarchy ([GitHub](https://github.com/ANNarchy/ANNarchy), [documentation](https://annarchy.github.io/), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6415039)). It is intended to help structure simulations with computational neuroscience models in a modular way and to make them more easily replicable.
People who want to start working with ANNarchy are strongly recommended to first learn exclusively the functionality of ANNarchy. CompNeuroPy uses very few features of ANNarchy at this time. But also adds various special features.
